## Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* Packages in requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code
The notebook is structured in 4 main tasks:
* Task 1: Obtaining and cleaning data
  * PCA, whitening, data augmentation
* Task 2: MLP implementation from scratch
* Task 3: Running the experiments
  * Regularization
  * CNN comparison
  * ResNet18 comparison (transfer learning)

Launch the Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab from your terminal (or use PyCharm/VSCode) and click run, all the tests will start running automatically
